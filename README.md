# Prescription-Handler
Designing a system to write formatted prescriptions based on dictation 
from doctor. The app will provide facility to sign the prescription and also 
send to the patient on his phone and email id and will be stored. The 
prescription will also include the symptoms, diagnosis and any type of advice 
to the patients. Now-a-days as it seems to be difficult to manage the written 
prescriptions given by doctors during our various visits. So this application 
will save all the prescription provided by doctor at a single secured place.The 
medibuddy app will allow user to store the prescription directly provided by 
doctor and can also contact the doctor during emergency situation for guidance 
or suggestions or any type of advice required.
